**UX Considerations**

<h3 align="center"> Strategy</h3>

The websites main target audience will be people that are looking to improve their life style and health, hence why I've provided the benefits of what the facilities could help the user with. Although the audience could range from teens to adults that are just looking for something to get into.

- As a user I want to be able to find the location of the facility without any issue.

- As a user I want the information provided to be accurate.

- As a user I want to be able to find the opening times easily to plan ahead.

- As a user I want to access the website without encountering any issues while clicking on links on the page and opening new tabs.

**The main objective of the website**

Is to provide information on what the Gym has to offer and what benefits the user could gain from it while also being able to easily navigate through the website and access the information easily.

Grand Gym’s website is designed to provide an intuitive, streamlined experience for users—whether they’re gym members, prospective clients, or fitness enthusiasts looking for information. The UX focuses on accessibility, ease of use, and a clean, motivational design. The primary goal is to keep users engaged while facilitating their fitness goals.

**Lighthouse testing**

For the lighthouse testing Ive only really encountered 2 issues, 1 was the images were too high resolution which is why I've used apps to downscale them and change their format to WEBP. The other issue I've encountered was third party cookies for embeded google maps which lowers my best practices score, i've found out there is a different way of implenting the google maps which requires use of Java script which im not too sure how to use yet.

Here are my results from lighthouse testing:
